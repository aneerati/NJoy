        about={"Princeton is a municipality that is located in Mercer County, New Jersey, and sits on just over 18 square miles. Princeton is known for the prestigious Princeton University, which is close to Nassau Street, Princeton's main commercial street. Nassau street is filled with local shops, restaurants, gyms, cafes, and much more. The several locally owned businesses funnel off of Nassau Street to form Palmer square, which hosts several events on special occasions. Outside of Princeton's commercial scene, you'll find a multitude of neighborhoods that give Princeton its residential feel. Princeton also has a rich history dating back to the 17th century. Several parks and trails follow in the footsteps of many historical figures who resided in Princeton."}

Princeton is a family-friendly town that sponsors many events for children. There are open fields around nearly every block, which makes Princeton the perfect place to bring pets."}
