        about={"Six Flags Great Adventure is an amusement park located in Jackson, New Jersey. The park features over a dozen major roller coaster and 52 other main attractions. Great Adventure is known for its thrilling coasters, such as Nitro, The Joker, and the tallest roller coaster in the world, Kingda Ka. In the summer, Hurrican Harbor, Six Flag's water park, opens for those looking for a splash. The water park features a large wave pool, a lazy river, and many attractions for thrill seekers ready to get wet. For a calmer and more family experience, the Wild Safari Drive-Thru Adventure is the perfect attraction for young kids. The safari allows parkgoers to view and sometimes interact will large animals like giraffes and rinhos without confining them in a small space. Both parks offer a variety of food options to ensure no family goes hungry."}
        thingstoknow={"Pets are not allowed inside any of the parks, with the exception of service animals. Almost all major attractions in Great Adventure and Hurrican Harbor have a height restriction, so being too short or too tall may affect your riding status. Unless you are on a meal plan with the park, the food options are not included, so it is important to carry money. Since many major attractions are high-speed roller coasters or water rides, it is recommended that parkgoers do not carry many belongings with them or they should rent a locker to store their items."}
        covid={"Face coverings at Six Flags attractions are not required but highly recommended for unvaccinated guests. There is also no vaccine requirement. Six Flags is committed to providing a healthy visit by implementing many hand sanitizing stations around the park."}
        addInfo={"Major attractions typically have long wait times. It is recommendend that parkgoers arrive early to get the most out of their visit. Alcohol may not be brought into the park and all bags will checked upon entering the parks. Alcholic beverages may be purchased inside the park but are prohibited from leaving the premises on which they were bought."} />
